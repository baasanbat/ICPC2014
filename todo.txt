Some things still need work:

- Ford-Fulkerson might be useful too
- k-D tree implementation? (maybe just for k=3 or so)
- The geometry library needs tests
	- A couple people have gone over it with a critical eye, so this is low priority
- The following files have yet to be reviewed:
	- MaximumFlowDinic.cc
	- Simplex.cc
